# Precious Puppy RPG

(jQuery, JS, Bootstrap) A cute RPG that teaches us all about precious, adorable, dueling puppies.

I naturally used several objects to store the RPG elements. I also tried to store the object property addresses (e.g. characters[playerCharacter].healthPoints) in variables when it made sense, such as when I kept having to call each character's HP.

I had fewer extras than Hangman (e.g. no audio or links), but I tried to use more CSS styling effects to spruce it up. It was nice getting more experience with CSS.
